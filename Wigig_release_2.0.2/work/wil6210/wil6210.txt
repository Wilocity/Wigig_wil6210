Introduction
============

The wil6210 is 60GHz wireless card by Wilocity.
It provides WiFi and wireless PCIE connectivity, as described in
the WiGig WBE spec.

This is PCIE device. It is combined with Atheros 2.4/5.2 GHz WiFi card.
On the PCI, it is represented as the following hierarchy:

1ae9:0101-+-1ae9:0201---168c:0034
          +-1ae9:0201---1ae9:0301
          +-1ae9:0201
          \-1ae9:0201

Chip consists of 1ae9:0101 is root bridge, with 4 ports 1ae9:0201.
One port routed to separate Atheros card 168c:0034, it is handled by the
ath9k driver.
Another port connected to the wil6210 device 1ae9:0301, that is on chip.
2 empty ports may be populated when connecting in WBE mode.

wil6210 device, 1ae9:0301, has one 2Mb BAR.

Network features
================

For the WiFi connection, it implements 802.11ad spec.
Supported are channels 1..3 with corresponded frequencies
58320, 60480, 62640 MHz.

wil6210 use cfg80211 framework, but not mac80211.

Modes supported are:

- monitor
- managed (station)
- AP

Driver designed in a way that hardware start running only when network
interface brought up, with either 'ifconfig up' or starting AP. All settings
made before are cached in the driver but not passed to the hardware.

iw commands supported
---------------------

iw link: query link status. Report current MCS.

Module parameters
=================

- rtap_include_phy_info
     Include PHY info in the radiotap header, default - no (bool)
- use_msi
     Use MSI interrupt: 0 - don't, 1 - (default) - single, or 3 (int)
- debug_fw
     load driver if FW not ready. For FW debug (bool)

wil6210 support set of interrupt handling modes:

- INTx - legacy pin interrupt. Do not use if possible.
- 1MSI - one MSI interrupt. This is the default mode.
- 3MSI - 3 MSI interrupts for {Tx, Rx, Misc}.

For interrupt handling mode, probed is highest one specified with @use_msi,
with fallback:

3MSI -> 1MSI -> INTx

On the x86 platform, multiple MSI interrupts are not supported with recent
kernel (3.7).

When @debug_fw set to true, driver probe will not fail if firmware do not
report "ready" event. This is to aid firmware boot issues debugging.

Sniffer
=======

To configure wil6210 in sniffer mode (assume $WLAN set to network
interface name):

# iw $WLAN set type monitor

Due to hardware/firmware deficiency, sniffer can capture either only
control PHY (CP) or only data PHY (DP). To configure for desired PHY type
do, after configuring for monitor mode:

For CP:
# iw $WLAN set monitor control
For DP:
# iw $WLAN set monitor none

Finally, bring interface up:

# ifconfig $WLAN up

Examples for AP mode
====================

AP mode may be started using wpa_supplicant of hostapd. Use latest development
snapshot of wpa_supplicant.

For the wpa_supplicant, start AP in non-secure mode with config:

---cut---
ap_scan=2

network={
        frequency=60480
        ssid="the_ssid_string"
        mode=2
        key_mgmt=NONE
}
---cut---

To start secure AP, use config:

---cut---
ap_scan=2

network={
        frequency=60480
        ssid="secure_ap"
        psk="passphrase"
        mode=2
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        proto=RSN
        pairwise=GCMP
        group=GCMP
}
---cut---

WMI commands
============

Control communication with the card is done through so called WMI commands
and events. Target access to the mailbox within memory in BAR0 used.
There are 2 similar mailbox structures: one for host->card commands, and one
for card->host events.

Tx/Rx
=====

DMA using 'vring' structures. Vring in consistent memory; hold descriptors
that points to the data buffers. Card to write status back to the descriptor.

There is one Rx vring. Tx vrings - multiple, per DA*TID.

Debug facilities
================

Dynamic debug
-------------

Almost all messages printed to the dmesg, are "dynamic debug" ones.
See Documentation/dynamic-debug-howto.txt for details.
Module "wil6210" uses format prefixes to identify message groups:

- "DBG[ IRQ]" for interrupt related messages. Prints every IRQ.
- "DBG[TXRX]" for Tx/Rx path. Prints every Tx/Rx package.
- "DBG[ WMI]" for WMI commands subsystem

Groups IRQ and TXRX are heavy traffic; enable only when required.
Group WMI is relatively low traffic, it prints only WMI messages.
It is good idea to enable it when debugging.

Debugfs
-------

All debugfs files placed under standard location for the cfg80211 devices,
$DEBUGFS/ieee80211/$PHY/ where $PHY is phy name like 'phy1'.

All wil6210 specific files placed under directory 'wil6210'.
Facilities provided:

- register access. All ICR (Interrupt Control Registers) groups represented as
  directories, with entries per register, allowing read/write.
  ITR (Interrupt Threshold Registers) represented as well.

- raw memory access. All memory sections represented as 'blob' files, providing
  read only access to the memory on card. Sections include:

+-------------------------------+---------------+
| blob_xxx  | BAR0    | Size    | Comment       |
| file name | offset  |         |               |
+-----------+---------+---------+---------------+
| rgf       |     0x0 |  0xa000 | Register file |
| fw_code   | 0x40000 | 0x40000 | FW code       |
| fw_data   | 0x80000 |  0x8000 | FW data       |
| fw_peri   | 0x88000 | 0x18000 | FW peripheral |
| uc_code   | 0xa0000 | 0x10000 | Ucode code    |
| uc_data   | 0xb0000 |  0x4000 | Ucode data    |
+-----------+---------+---------+---------------+

Raw memory access used by firmware/ucode trace extractor. See below. Also,
raw memory dump may be obtained for later analysis.

- DWORD memory read, as FW see it. Files 'mem_addr' and 'mem_val' provide
  access to the memory, using FW addresses (FW memory mapping is somewhat
  different from what host see in BAR0). Write address to the 'mem_addr', then
  read 'mem_val'. It will reads like "[0x%08x] = 0x%08x\n", addr, value

- mailbox for WMI commands events. File 'mbox' reads like:

ring tx = {
  base = 0x008802e8
  size = 0x0028 bytes -> 5 entries
  tail = 0x00880300
  head = 0x00880300

  [ 4] E    0x00841070 -> 1fc8 001e 0000 00

      : 00 00 00 20 04 07 01 88 ff 02 00 00 01 00
}
ring rx = {
  base = 0x00880318
  size = 0x0040 bytes -> 8 entries
  tail = 0x00880320
  head = 0x00880320
  entry size = 256
  [ 0] E    0x00842f98 -> 24f8 000c 0000 00
      : 00 00 0a 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  [ 1] E th 0x00000000 -> 2020 0f80 0000 c0
  [ 2] E    0x00000000 -> 2020 0f80 0000 c0
  [ 3] E    0x00000000 -> 2020 0f80 0000 c0
  [ 4] E    0x00000000 -> 2020 0f80 0000 c0
  [ 5] E    0x00000000 -> 2020 0f80 0000 c0
  [ 6] E    0x00000000 -> 2020 0f80 0000 c0
  [ 7] E    0x00000000 -> 2020 0f80 0000 c0
}

There are 2 separate rings, one for Tx, or host->card commands; and 2-nd
for Rx, or card->host events.

Printed for each ring (all addresses in FW memory mapping):
  - base address of ring in card's memory
  - ring size in bytes and entries
  - tail and head pointers
  - max. entry size. It is fake for Rx - FW may allocate entry of arbitrary size
  - mailbox entries, format for entry:


       /-- 'E' for empty entry, 'F' for full
       | /+-- 't' for tail, 'h' for head
       | ||
 index | || address       /-mbox header---\ [seq,len,type,flags]
    v  v vv   v           v               v
  [ 3] E th 0x00841578 -> 1fc7 001e 0000 00
      : 00 00 07 00 00 00 00 00 ff ff 03 00 00 00 00 00
      : 00 00 00 20 04 07 01 88 ff 02 00 00 01 00
        \--buffer content (if valid)------------------/

- Tx/Rx DMA Vrings. File 'vrings' reads as:

VRING rx = {
  pa     = 0x00000000bb075000
  va     = 0xffff8800bb075000
  size   = 128
  swtail = 127
  swhead = 0
  hwtail = [0x008813c8] -> 0x0000007f
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHS
}

There is one block for Rx DMA vring and one for every Tx DMA vring.

Information printed:
  - addresses, physical (pa) and virtual (va)
  - size, entries
  - software head and tail pointers
  - hardware tail, format: [fw addr] -> value
  - One letter per vring entry, 'H' for hardware owned and 'S'
    for software owned ones.
